This website is my corner of the internet. 

It's a perpetual work in progress, (much like life), and I appreciate you stopping by. It's where I try to record my story. The story of my life. 

The story of my life, _with computers_. 
## Who Am I?
I'm a self-taught developer, and I've been learning to program since 2013. A lot of my recent work has been surrounding reverse proxies, web performance, edge caching and network monitoring. 
In my spare time, I am currently exploring IndieWeb and the Fediverse.

You can contact me [by email](mailto:hello@ishan.page) at hello@ishan.page

## Start Here
