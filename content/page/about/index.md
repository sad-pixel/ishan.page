# Hi There, I'm Ishan.

I was fascinated by coding from a young age. I taught myself how to code from the ground up, and I have never stopped learning and exploring new possibilities.

Over the past ten years, I have worked on various projects that challenged me to grow as a coder and a problem-solver. I have learned how to build software that is reliable, scalable and performant, and that serves the needs of millions of users.

Thank you for visiting my blog, where I share my journey, thoughts, and experiences with you. I hope you find something useful and inspiring here. 

Currently, I am working on DDoS mitigation systems at Asians Group LLC. I have previously worked on systems and websites using OpenCV, Python, Django, PHP, Laravel, Vue, Eleventy, and many others.

The beautiful photo was taken by my friend Sabyasachi Das in scenic Pondicherry, India.
