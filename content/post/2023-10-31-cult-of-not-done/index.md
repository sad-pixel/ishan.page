Dear Members of the Cult of Not Done,

I present to you a manifesto of not done. This was inspired by [Kio Stark and Bre Pettis](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13), and written over five days because it was, obviously, not done.

# The Cult of Not Done Manifesto

1. There are four states of being. Not knowing, action, refinement, and completion.
2. Accept that everything is a draft. We have to make it better before we can be done.
3. We live in the editing stage. Nothing is ever done because it's always being improved.
4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, but not good enough. So spend all your time making things perfect.
5. Embrace procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, give it more time. Your subconscious needs to think more, and it will give you the answer soon.
6. The point of being done is to finish, and until we don't, we can't get other things done.
7. If you're never done, you can throw it away.
8. Laugh at those who settle. It’s boring and keeps you from being perfection.
9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right. The more time you spend trying different things and not being done, the more authority you have on it.
10. Failure and mistakes are natural and to be expected since you're not done yet.
11. Destruction is a force of progress. Start over often with increased scope to make your creation perfect.
12. If you have an idea, never publish it on the internet, then it will be stolen from you.
13. In Progress is the engine of more.
