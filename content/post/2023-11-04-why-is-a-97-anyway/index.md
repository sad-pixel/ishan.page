...It makes absolutely no sense!", is what I thought to myself as I sat in that 9th grade computer science class. 

My mind churned at the thought of having to memorize this little factoid, along with the other one that 'A' = 65, because it absolutely would be asked on the exam. Oh man, CS was supposed to be about computers and doing things with them and stuff, not memorizing stupid numbers!

"Why do they care about this inane piece of trivia?"

Many years later, I now know that this "little factoid" actually has huge ramifications, and I wish someone had explained it to me back then. I'm going to try to put it all into context.
